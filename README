 This is for CSC 172 Project 01 where the purpose of the code is encode an input file into bytes and then 0's and 1's 
 as well as to decode that output by using the error correcting Hamming code to convert that back to the original type file
 we input the first place. For Hamming 7,4, the steps in the code was to convert the content of the file if that be integer
 or string or what else into bytes which are represented by 8 digits. We split that 8 digit into four and run through the 
 generating matrix from Hamming code and result with a 7 digit result. That's the encoding part. The decoding part starts by
 multiplying that 7 digit to the Hamming code check parity matrix or H Matrix to convert it back to 4 digit and then shrink 
 that array of 4 digits into array of 8 digits and then convert it back to the original content of the input file into the 
 decode file. The Hamming class represents such encoding and decoding methods for Hamming 7,4 while Hamming15_11 class includes
 the similar methods except with Hamming 15,11 code not 7,4. So for Hamming 15,11 methods, the process starts by converting the 
 content of the input file as 8 digit code but instead of splitting them in half, add three zeros in the very front of each eight 
 digit binary numbers. With that multiply with the Hamming 15,11 generator code so you'll result with a fifteen digit code. 
 From that we pull out the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th digit of that fifteen digit number 
 to create an eight digit number to convert that back to the original content of the input file. 
 
 Hamming7_4 textfile is the input file, Hamming7_4_OUTPUT textfile is the array of 7 digits that we result with after the encoding 
 method while Hamming7_4_OUTPUT has the result of the decoding method; Hamming_15_11 is the input file using the corresponding 
 Hamming 15,11 code, Hamming_15_11_OUTPUT is the result of the encoding method while Hamming_15_11Decode is the result 
 (identical to inputfile) after the decoding method.
